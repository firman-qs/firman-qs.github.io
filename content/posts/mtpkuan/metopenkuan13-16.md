## Identitas Artikel
- **Judul**: Impacts of an AI-based chatbot on college students’ after-class review, academic performance, self-efficacy, learning attitude, and motivation.
- **Penulis**: Yen-Fen Lee, Gwo-Jen Hwang, Pei-Ying Chen
- **Jurnal**: Education Tech Research Dev (2022) 70:1843–1865
- **Tautan**: [https://doi.org/10.1007/s11423-022-10142-8](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1y_7VmwfBabPEFhSSEWRovTEgGuJtAsDp/view?usp=sharing)

## Objective
The article aims to examine whether integrating an AI-based chatbot into after-class review activities improves:

1. Academic performance
1. Self-efficacy
1. Learning attitude
1. Learning motivation

(Research questions listed on page 5–6). The chatbot is used as a tool for personalized, immediate feedback during review of public health infectious diseases.

## Methods
### Desain
- Quasi-experimental design (page 9)
- Two groups:
  - Experimental: chatbot-assisted review (n=18)
  - Control: traditional teacher-assisted review (n=20)

### Duration
2-week intervention, two sessions/week (page 10)

### Instruments
- Learning motivation questionnaire (Wang & Chen, 2010)
- Learning attitude questionnaire (Hwang et al., 2013)
- Self-efficacy scale (Pintrich et al., 1991)
- Semi-structured interviews

(page 9–10)

### Analysis
- ANCOVA for post-test comparisons while controlling for pre-test scores (page 12–14).
- Qualitative thematic coding for interview data (page 15–16).

## Results
_Significant Improvements for Experimental Group_
The chatbot group outperformed the control group in all measured areas:
| Variable                 | F-value | p-value | Effect size (η²) | Notes                            |
| ------------------------ | ------- | ------- | ---------------- | -------------------------------- |
| **Learning achievement** | 7.70    | < .01   | 0.18             | Large effect (Table 1, page 12)  |
| **Self-efficacy**        | 9.25    | < .01   | 0.21             | Large effect (Table 2, page 13)  |
| **Learning attitude**    | 8.60    | < .01   | 0.19             | Large effect (Table 3, page 13)  |
| **Learning motivation**  | 5.39    | < .05   | 0.13             | Medium effect (Table 4, page 14) |

## Qualitative Themes
Students reported:
- Increased engagement and willingness to ask questions
- Ubiquitous access to answers
- Personalized feedback enhancing intrinsic motivation

Some limitations noted by students:
- Chatbot lacks human nuance, sometimes answers “I don’t know”
- Incomplete or overly short replies on complex cases

## Kesimpulan
The study demonstrates that integrating an AI-based chatbot into after-class review significantly enhances performance, self-belief, attitudes, and motivation. The authors attribute this to:
- Instant feedback
- Reduced shyness / hesitation in asking questions
- Rich knowledge base about public health
- Personalized learning pathway

However, limitations include novelty effect, short duration, small sample size, and chatbot’s inability to answer complex queries.

## Advantages of the Article
- Proper ANCOVA checks: Levene’s test + homogeneity of regression.
- Clear theoretical grounding: constructivism, feedback theory, AI in education literature.
- Quantitative + qualitative triangulation strengthens credibility.
- Uses a real government-developed chatbot (Disease Stewardship App).

## Gaps and Limitations
- Extremely small sample (n=38)
- Short-term intervention
- No learning analytics, the study does not analyze: Chat logs, Misconceptions, Cognitive processes.
- The article itself doesn’t investigate: why some students benefit more, what profile (prior knowledge, attitudes) influences success.
