It always annoying for me ketika saya hear kolega that say $\omega=$ "the
lecturer never explain it"[^1]. Or, for a such a simple question, things that
not need to be known immediately or--at least--can just accepted as the axiom for right now, they
asking it. I have a conjecture 

$$
\forall \alpha \geq \eta \Rightarrow \alpha \propto d = \frac{1}{i}.
$$
where $\alpha \geq \eta$ is "asking more than a treshold $\eta$", $d$ is
learning dependence, and $i$ is learning independence.


[^1]: I also have opinion about this, the modern education with its modern teacher.
