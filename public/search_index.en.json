DE maintains a population of candidate solutions and\nrefines them over generations.\n🏗️ Algorithm Structure\nAt its core, DE consists of 4 steps:\n\nInitialization\nMutation\nCrossover\nSelection\n\n1. Initialization\nWe start by initializing a population of $ N_p $ individuals:\n\nwhere $\\mathbf{l}$ and $\\mathbf{u}$ are the lower and upper bounds of the search space.\n2. Mutation\nFor each individual $\\mathbf{x}_{i,G}$ in generation $ G $, we generate a\ndonor vector  \n using the DE/rand/1 strategy:\n\nWhere:\n\n$ r_1, r_2, r_3 \\in {1, \\dots, N_p} $ are distinct and different from $ i $,\n$ F \\in [0, 2] $ is the differential weight (commonly $ F = 0.5 $).\n\nOther strategies include DE/best/1, DE/current-to-best/1, etc.\n3. Crossover\nTo increase diversity, DE uses binomial crossover to create a trial vector $ \\mathbf{u}_{i,G+1} $:\n\nWhere:\n\n$ C_r \\in [0, 1] $ is the crossover rate,\n$ j_{\\text{rand}} $ ensures at least one component from $ \\mathbf{v}_{i,G+1} $ is selected.\n\n4. Selection\nFinally, apply a greedy selection:\n\nWhere $ f(\\cdot) $ is the objective function being minimized.\n🔁 Repeat\nRepeat mutation, crossover, and selection for each generation until a stopping criterion is met (e.g., max iterations or convergence threshold).\nRust Implementation (will be completed soon)\n\nObjective Function\nMichalewicz\n\nGriewank\n\nSphere\n\nReference\n\nPrice, K.V., Storn, R.M. and Lampinen, J.A.

I have tested on my fedora and it\nworks fine. For other distributions it should be the same, just complete\nthe necessary packages. I'll try to give a little guidance.\nNote Before you go and copy my config, read the section below for the\ndependencies and short tutorial to get started. if I didn't miss\nanything, this should be enough to get your linux to use this xmonad\nconfiguration.\nCredit: https://xmonad.org,\nhttps://gitlab.com/dtos\nDocumentation\n\nhttps://xmonad.org/documentation.html What I will tell you next, all\ncome from the documentation. Documentation is the most important thing\nwhen you learn something, whether it's a window manager, programming\nlanguage, etc. Here are some links to the xmonad documentation:\n\nhttps://xmonad.org/documentation.html\nDocumentation home page.\nhttps://xmonad.org/INSTALL.html\nOn how to install xmonad.\nHackage Documentation, It contains further documentation, like what\nlibraries you can use, how to use them, more like how to use haskell\nfor xmonad.\n\nhttps://hackage.haskell.org/package/xmonad\nhttps://hackage.haskell.org/package/xmonad-contrib\n\n\n\n\nInstalling xmonad\nIn general, the process is the same, the difference is which method you\nuse. Either use your distro's package manager, or build from source with\ncabal or stack. This time I will use the package manager, because I find\nit easier and use less space. Of course if you want to play with haskell\nmore deeply, using stack or cabal is great.\n\n\nInstalling dependencies\nThe dependencies are the same, but the names may differ in different\npackage managers. I will give an example for Fedora, for other\ndistros, you can open the install xmonad documentation\nlink that I provided before. Run\nin terminal\n\n\n\nMake xmonad config directory\nThis is where you store all configurations. The new xmonad saves its\nconfiguration in ~/.config/xmonad, while the older version is in\n~/.xmonad. In my case, the fedora package manager provided xmonad\nwhich seemed to be older, so I saved the configuration in\n~/.xmonad. If you are using a distro like arch linux you will\nprobably use ~/.config/xmonad instead. Just test which one works\nlater. To make configuration directory:\n\n\n\nInstalling xmonad\nThree things you need to install, xmonad itself, xmonad-contrib\n(Community-maintained tiling algorithms and extension modules for\nxmonad), and the bar (unless you don't want bar 😁). The bar that is\ncommonly used in conjunction with xmonad is xmobar and\ndistrotube\nhas a great tutorial on this. The other bar, which I'll be using in\nthis configuration is polybar, so we'll be installing that as well.\nOn fedora:\n\nRemember, the package name may be different in each package manager\nthat your distro uses. Use package search to help you, for example,\non arch linux you can use pacman -Ss pkg-name-you-are-looking-for,\nor on ubuntu: ~apt search pkg-name-you-are-looking-for. if i\nremember correctly, on arch linux the names are xmonad,\nxmonad-contrib (without ghc-), and polybar. So on an arch based\ndistro you can do:\n\n\n\nAnother thing to install\n\n\nDmenu\nXmonad uses dmenu by default, you can copy my patched dmenu (see\nmy dmenu build) and\ninstall it or install the plain version\n(https://tools.suckless.org/dmenu) and patch it yourself. Of\ncourse you can use rofi or another launcher, just set it in\nkeybinding later.\n\n\nDbus\nTo easily display XMonad status in polybar we need DBus\nmonitoring and i use\nxintron/xmonad-log for\nthat. Xmonad-log allows us to send status over DBus using\nXMonad's DynamicLog to any application that support executing\ncustom scripts such as polybar.\n\nFirst we need to install\ndbus. Again, i'm\nusing fedora here:\n\n\n\n\nNext, we need to install golang to build xmonad-log:\n\n\n\nThen we clone the xmonad-log repository. On its\ngithub it says we\nneed to clone it to\n$GOPATH/src/github.com/xintron/xmonad-log. $GOPATH is a\nvariable used by Go to reference the location where all\nproject folders are stored. However, Setup Go project using\n$GOPATH is not recommended for the latest version of Go,\ninstead we use Go Modules. So just clone to our home\ndirectory, or any other directory you want.\n\n\n\nNow go to xmonad-log directory which we have clone, by\nordering:\n\n\n\nOnce we're on xmonad-log directory, then we initilize new Go\nproject by:\n\n\n\nThen add dependencies to current module and install them,\nby:\n\n\n\nNow we build it\n\n\n\nThis will give you an xmonad-log binary in the directory. Move\nthis to an appropriate directory in your $PATH.\n\n\n\n\nIMPORTS\nThese are Haskell modules that we must import so that we can use their\nfunctions later in the config. We use import stetement for to import\nmodules. Qualified import makes the imported module only available in\nqualified form, eg. it force an obligatory namespace qualifier to\nimported identifiers. A qualified import allows us to use functions with\nthe same name from several modules. Because there is a namespace,\nhaskell doesn't get agitated.\n\nVARIABLES\nIt's nice to assign values to stuff that you will use more than once in\nthe config. Setting values for things like font, terminal and editor\nmeans you only have to change the value here to make changes globally.\n\nAUTOSTARTS\nThis is a program that automatically runs on startup or restarting\nxmonad. We need to store it in startupHook on main method\n(this similar to main in other languages, such as c). For now we\nstore it in myStartupHook first then put it later on startupHook.\n\nLAYOUTS\nDefining the layouts that I want to have available. This require us to\nimport modules XMonad.Layout.\n\nWORKSPACES\nThisi worspace configuration contains workspace name, how make custom\nxmonad polybar-module clickable, and theme for workspace name on change\npopup.\n\nMANAGEHOOK\nSets some rules for certain programs. Examples include forcing certain\nprograms to always float, or to always appear on a certain workspace.\nForcing programs to a certain workspace with a doShift requires xdotool\nif you are using clickable workspaces. You need the className or title\nof the program. Use xprop to get this info.\n\nSYSTEM SOUNDS\nAvailable sounds that are part of the default\ndtos-sounds package include:\n\nmenu-01.mp3\nmenu-02.mp3\nmenu-03.mp3\nshutdown-01.mp3\nshutdown-02.mp3\nshutdown-03.mp3\nstartup-01.mp3\nstartup-02.mp3\nstartup-03.mp3\n\n\nNAMED ACTIONS\nNamedActions is a wrapper for keybinding configuration that can list\nthe available keybindings. The following custom functions are used to\nadd NamedActions to our keybindings in the format that I desired.\nsubTitle' allows me to format the subtitle (subKeys) so that I can\nprepend and/or append text to them. showKeybindings is a function that\npipes the output of our NamedActions into a GUI display program, such\nas 'yad' or 'zenity'.\n\nKEYBINDINGS\nThis config use the\nXmonad.Util.EZConfig\nmodule, that make keybindings to be written in simpler form. The\nSuper/Windows key is 'M' (the modkey), the ALT key is 'M1'. Shift is 'S'\nand CTRL is 'C'. If you dont know what is the name of key actually is,\nalways refer to EZConfig\ndocumentation\n(for example, the backspace key is written as &lt;Backspace&gt;, note it is\nenclosed in &lt;…&gt; and the initial letter is capitalized). Each group of\nkeybindings must have a subKeys heading, and each individual\nkeybinding must use addName to add a description. These headings and\ndescriptions are needed for the keybindings list that can be launched\nwith 'M-F1'.\nNote will complete the table later, the key should be\nself-explanatory. I will give you small example: \"M-C-r\" means you need\nto press Modkey+Ctrl+r \"M-x r\" means you need to press Modkey+x, release\nit, then press r\nA FEW KEYBINDINGSASSOCIATED ACTION\nMODKEY + RETURNopens terminal\n\n\nMAKE XMONAD AND POLYBAR TALK TO EACH OTHER\nAs i have explained before, we need to integrate xmonad to visualize the\ncurrent window title and workspaces in polybar. To make xmonad and\npolybar talk we only need to add [module/xmonad] in our polybar config\nand polybar ready to talk. Now, for xmonad to talk, we need to configure\nit to send log events information via\ndbus using XMonad's\nDynamicLog with the help of xmonad-log. The pretty printing\n(PP)\noptions, allows us to customize the formatting of status information.\n\nTHE MAIN\nThis is the \"main\" of XMonad. This where everything in our configs comes\ntogether and works.\n\n","description":"Nothing special, just XMonad rice","id":"https://firman-qs.github.io/posts/hacking-on-xmonad/","path":"/posts/hacking-on-xmonad/","title":"Hacking on $(\\lambda) \\to$ XMonad "},"https://firman-qs.github.io/posts/plotting-fresnel-py/":{"body":"Introduction: Simple Equation Derivation\nWe start with Fresnel Equations\n\nwhere\n\nand\n\nIf we assume the special case where $\\mu_1 \\cong \\mu_2 \\cong \\mu_0$ then\n\nBased on Snell's law we know that\n\nUsing identity \n then the previous $ \\alpha $ equation (2) becomes\n\nFor reflectance and transmittance\n\nSource Code\nhttps://github.com/firman-qs/fresnel-equation-plot-python.\nFinal Result\n\nVideo on Plotting Fresnel Equations\n\n\t\n\t\n\n","description":"Plotting Fresnel equation using numpy and matplotlib","id":"https://firman-qs.github.io/posts/plotting-fresnel-py/","path":"/posts/plotting-fresnel-py/","title":"Plotting Fresnel Equation"},"https://firman-qs.github.io/projects/":{"body":"","description":"","id":"https://firman-qs.github.io/projects/","path":"/projects/","title":"Projects"},"https://firman-qs.github.io/projects/project-1/":{"body":"Example project page\n","description":"Intentionally Unstable Physics Simulation (for now only electromagnetics).
